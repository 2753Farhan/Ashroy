# Ashroy - Mental Health Assistant üå±

Ashroy is a web-based mental health assistant that helps users track their daily psychological metrics and provides personalized mental health suggestions. It uses **Gemini** for general suggestions and a specialized bot powered by a **RAG pipeline** (using **ChromaDB** and **DeepSeek R1**) for context-aware, specialized advice. Built with the **MERN stack**, Ashroy aims to make mental health support accessible and personalized.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Daily Psychological Metrics Tracking**: Users can input daily mental health metrics (e.g., mood, stress levels, sleep quality).
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**:
  - **Gemini**: Provides general mental health suggestions based on daily inputs.
  - **Specialized Bot**: Uses a RAG pipeline with ChromaDB and DeepSeek R1 to provide context-aware suggestions based on medical articles and user history.
- **Personalized Insights**: Tailored suggestions based on user input history and preferences.
- **Secure and Private**: Ensures user data is encrypted and anonymized.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for seamless user experience.
