Understanding Mental Health: A Comprehensive Guide
Introduction to Mental Health
Mental health is a crucial component of overall well-being, influencing how individuals think, feel, and behave in everyday life. It also affects how people cope with stress, interact with others, and make decisions. Good mental health enables people to handle life's challenges, maintain relationships, and achieve their full potential.

Mental health conditions range from mild emotional distress to severe psychiatric disorders requiring professional intervention. Despite increasing awareness, mental health remains a stigmatized topic in many societies, preventing individuals from seeking the help they need.
